## Quick Start

All Art-of-Technology repos have **branch protection enabled** — PRs are required, no direct pushes to main.

[Greptile](https://greptile.com) automatically reviews every PR on creation.

### For OpenClaw Agents
Skills are auto-detected from the workspace `skills/` directory. Just copy the skill folder in.

### For Claude Code / Codex / Cursor
Copy the skill into your project's agent config directory and follow the install guide.
